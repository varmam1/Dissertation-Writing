\frametitle{Problem Statement and Solution}

Given two or three images of people's faces and a relationship, we want to be able to say if the people in the pictures have that given relationship. For example, given the following pair of images:
\vspace{5mm}

\adjustbox{center}{
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{face_example}
}

\vspace{5mm}
We want to be able to tell that they are mother and daughter. 

To do this, we are implementing the paper ``Weighted Graph Embedding-Based Metric
Learning for Kinship Verification" and verifying their results.

%An indication of what work has been completed and how this relates to the timetable and work plan in the original proposal. The progress report should answer the following questions:
	% Is the project on schedule and if not, how many weeks behind or ahead?
	% What unexpected difficulties have arisen?
	% Briefly, what has been accomplished?



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What's Been Accomplished}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Face Detection}: The ability to detect faces and save them as $64 \times 64$ images
	\item All of the face descriptors were implemented: \textbf{LBP}, \textbf{HOG}, \textbf{SIFT-variant}, \textbf{VGG}
	\item The main algorithm, \textbf{WGEML}, was implemented
	\item Scripts to run the \textbf{training and testing} end to end were written
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Results}
The actual accuracies obtained were as follows:

\scalebox{0.7}{\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
	Dataset & Restricted & FS & FD & MS & MD & FMS & FMD & avg\\ \hline
	KinFaceW-I & Unrestricted & 0.8015 & 0.7166 & 0.7628 & 0.7921 &&& 0.76825 \\ 
	KinFaceW-I & Restricted & 0.811 & 0.7391 & 0.7405 & 0.769 &&& 0.7649\\ 
	KinFaceW-II & Unrestricted & 0.846 & 0.764 & 0.814 & 0.8		 &&& 0.806 \\ 
	KinFaceW-II & Restricted & 0.838 & 0.768 & 0.802 & 0.8	&&& 0.802 \\ 
	TSKinFace & - &0.9201 & 0.8826 & 0.9162 & 0.9182 & 0.9571 & 0.9343 &0.9214 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}}
\vspace{0.25cm}

These differ from the paper's results as follows, in terms of percentage:

\frametitle{Next Steps} % Change to be something like future efforts?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ablation studies
	\item Extending the functionality to work with videos
	\item Testing how adding different face descriptors affects it
	\item Experimenting slight modifications in some existing face descriptors to see how it impacts performance
	\item Using a different, smaller network than VGG for one of the face descriptors
\end{itemize}
