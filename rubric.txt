	What they say:
	- Intro:
		What is the problem, anyway?
			• Explain your problem clearly
			• Explain why this problem is interesting
			• What does the solution enable?
		What is your project, anyway?
			• Describe the thing you built
			• Explain how it solves the problem
			• Not too much detail
	- Prep:
		Background Knowledge
			1. Explain any theory that you needed to use
			2. Rule of thumb: anything outside of 1B should be explained
			3. Rule of thumb: anything needed to make sense of your later
			choices
			4. Consult your supervisor!
		Requirements Analysis
			1. Which techniques and tools could you use?
			2. What did you actually decided use?
			3. Which factors led you to your decision?
		Methods and Tools
			1. What are the engineering practices your project followed?
			2. How do they arise from the nature of your project?
				• Software: testing and source control
				• Datasets: validation and cleanup
				• Experiments: Ethics reviews, etc
			3. How does this compare to good engineering practice? (For
			better and worse!)
	- Implementation:
		- candidates are required to draw attention 
		  to the parts of the work which are not their own, 
		  in accordance with the Implementation section
		  
		What is the project?
			• Describe the repository layout
			• This should be a description of the project design and
			methodology
			• What does the project actually do?
		Methods
			1. How do the methods from Chapter 2 apply to this project?
			2. What worked?
			3. What did you try that didn’t work?
			4. How did your approach change throughout the project?
		Project Result
			• Explain the functionality of the project
			• Explain the limitations of this approach
	
	- Evaluation
		1. Explain your evaluation methods
		2. Give your results
		3. Compare the results of your project to your success criteria
		4. Interpret what the results teach you
	
	- Conclusion
		• Key question: what have you learned?
		• What would you do differently if you wanted to do this again?
		• What is your advice to other people who want to do this?
