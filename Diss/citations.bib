In this paper, we investigate the problem of video-based kinship verification via human face analysis. While several attempts have been made on facial kinship verification from still images, to our knowledge, the problem of video-based kinship verification has not been formally addressed in the literature. In this paper, we make the two contributions to video-based kinship verification. On one hand, we present a new video face dataset called Kinship Face Videos in the Wild (KFVW) which were captured in wild conditions for the video-based kinship verification study, as well as the standard benchmark. On the other hand, we employ our benchmark to evaluate and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art metric learning based kinship verification methods. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed dataset and the effectiveness of existing metric learning methods for video-based kinship verification. Lastly, we also evaluate human ability on kinship verification from facial videos and experimental results show that metric learning based computational methods are not as good as that of human observers.},

abstract = "Grounds for thinking that the model described in the previous paper can be used to support general biological principles of social evolution are briefly discussed. Two principles are presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination. Some tentative evidence is given. More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination."
