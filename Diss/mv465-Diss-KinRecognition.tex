%\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
%
%To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
%complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
%student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
%should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
%should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
%incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
%\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the makefile.  It should
%explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
%Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
%finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
%dissertation.
%
%
%\section*{Work Completed}
%
%All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.
%
%\section*{Special Difficulties}
%
%Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
%document on both Ubuntu Linux and OS X.
