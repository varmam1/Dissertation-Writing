For CifarNet images, this website looks useful (you may have already seen it). I had to set the "Spacing Between Filters" to the absolute minimum for it to look at all sensible with the number of channels we're using.

At a higher level, it would be nice to use something you've learned from your experiments to inspire a new experiment. It may be too late for this now, and it's certainly not a high priority.

Did you find yourself with any new questions after seeing your results? One question I had was whether you could use the relative importance of the different face descriptors to focus on the best ones and extend them slightly to cover their weaknesses. This is a bit awkward if VGG is the best one, but there might be other options.

Overall:
- Look over captions of figures

Intro:
* It might be useful to have a diagram to illustrate the problem. e.g. [image, image, "father-daughter"] -> ✓
- Stronger hook sentence and motivations

Prep:
* 2.3.4 (and 2.8.3?): mention/cite the celebrity dataset you used - it currently sounds like you curated all the images.
- Redraw/source figures

Implementation:
- Maybe make requrements analysis a table?

Evaluation:
- Create figures for the actual original results
- More in-depth analysis in certain places
- Might want to put standard deviations in the CFN Extension
- Might want to put the raw table data in the appendix?

Conclusion:
- Retouch

Project:
- ROC Curves
- Ablation Studies by blocking image
- Update README to be a proper README
