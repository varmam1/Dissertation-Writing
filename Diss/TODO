For CifarNet images, this website looks useful (you may have already seen it). I had to set the "Spacing Between Filters" to the absolute minimum for it to look at all sensible with the number of channels we're using.

At a higher level, it would be nice to use something you've learned from your experiments to inspire a new experiment. It may be too late for this now, and it's certainly not a high priority.

Did you find yourself with any new questions after seeing your results? One question I had was whether you could use the relative importance of the different face descriptors to focus on the best ones and extend them slightly to cover their weaknesses. This is a bit awkward if VGG is the best one, but there might be other options.

Overall:
- Look over captions of figures and placement of figures

Intro:
* It might be useful to have a diagram to illustrate the problem. e.g. [image, image, "father-daughter"] -> ✓
 * You will probably need to define terms like CNN and SVM the first time you use them
- Stronger hook sentence and motivations

Prep:
* 2.3: perhaps name the distance metric you're using, and include a forward reference to section 2.4?.
* 2.3.1: it might be worth mentioning how you convert to greyscale. Again, there are multiple methods, and they probably have their own names. Perhaps too much detail for this section though?
* 2.3.4 (and 2.7.3?): mention/cite the celebrity dataset you used - it currently sounds like you curated all the images.
- Do the CNN and Face Detection sections
- Redraw/source figures
- Change name of "Side Algorithms Used (Temp Name)" section

Implementation:
 * 3.3.1: it's not clear why you used a non-standard implementation of SIFT. I think you were following some other reference?
          - but it's worth being explicit and reminding the reader that you were following the technique of a different paper.
- Finish the figures (CFN Arch)
- Figure out how to do the repository overview 
- Maybe make requrements analysis a table?

Evaluation:
- Create figures for the actual original results
- More in-depth analysis in certain places
- Might want to put standard deviations in the CFN Extension
- Might want to put the raw table data in the appendix?

* 4.2: I want to suggest reminding the reader what the requirements were, instead of just saying they were all completed, but you had a lot of requirements, so I'm not sure how to make that work succinctly

Conclusion:
- Retouch

Project:
- ROC Curves
- Ablation Studies by blocking image
- Update README to be a proper README
