Overall:
- Look over captions of figures

Intro:
- Stronger hook sentence and motivations

Prep:
- Redraw/source figures
- Maybe move SIFT to appendix

Implementation:
* SIFT implementation low priority
* Flowchart for pipelines potentially

Evaluation:
- Create figures for the actual original results
- More in-depth analysis in certain places
- Might want to put standard deviations in the CFN Extension
- Might want to put the raw table data in the appendix?

Conclusion:
- Retouch

Project:
- ROC Curves
- Ablation Studies by blocking image
- Update README to be a proper README

- Add appendices for KNN and cascade classifiers. 

- need to edit my introduction again
- read it over again while keeping the assessment guidelines in mind
