Daniel:
List of figures: Some of the captions are quite long and don't make much sense out of context. 
When you caption a figure, you can use \caption[short description]{long description} to tidy 
this up. e.g. \caption[VGG network configurations]{The different configurations...}

Introduction, first sentence: it sounds like kinship recognition is defined as using facial 
features. I expect that they're very useful, but that there are other ways of doing it.

2.1.1: "The kernel is then started in the top left of the input..." -> While this is a nice 
human way to think about it, it's a little odd to include in a definition. The kernel can be 
applied everywhere in parallel, so there isn't really a starting point.


Rob:

* "the major setup of the project." - what is meant by this? The overall structure of the project? or how the project was tackled/decomposed etc.?
* 2.3.2 "Another face descriptor" - is this the best way to start a subsection?
 * 2.3.2.1 "First, we.." - again is there a better sentence perhaps?
* Figure 3.1 - could you add short descriptions of the key files? (there is lots of space on the right)
* p.27 "There are 3 main stages" - I would use words for small numbers
* p.29 "As mentioned...." 
I would be tempted to simply write:
"We abbreviate "father"..... (as discussed in section 2.7.3)"
Might you even start with the sentence "The project is run end-to-end for..." and then explain the naming? Daniel, you have a good sense for these things?
* "differences go higher than 8:89%" - would "are above..... which fulfils  the project's success criteria."
* section 4.2
- "from [11]" - I would avoid using cites as nouns, use the author names and cite etc.
- "according to Appendix C" - according to the goals defined in your proposal?

"Overall, the project was successful since I was able to implement each of the core components,
as specified in section 2.6 and, this allowed me to replicate the findings of the WGEML paper
within a 15% error range."
-> not sure... perhaps reword?
"Overall, the project successfully reproduced the implementation and results presented in the WGEML paper within a 15% error range. Furthermore, ...." or similar?

5.1 - is this sort of testing especially valuable in the context of ML where bugs may otherwise go unnoticed perhaps?

"If I were to do the project over again, I think using more sophisticated software engineering
tools such as some continuous integration tool such as Jenkins together with a containerization
tool such as Docker would help immensely."
  - just tidy/reword this sentence perhaps?

"In the future, the model can be extended to work on videos."
->  how about?
"It would be interesting to extend the approach to work with video input...."
do you need to remind the reader that you didn't do it? (*:
Better to use the text to describe why this is interesting? How might video help? What extra challenges would it raise? What would the approach be to handling video? What range of approaches might be interesting etc. Demonstrate your interest/knowledge and enthusiasm for the area... 




Prep:
ROB:
* A thought: do you fulfill the requirements listed here: 
https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist-v2.0.pdf
(Machine Learning Reproducibility Checklist from the NeurIPS 2020 conference)
If so, perhaps you could claim it, or add it as a requirement in Chapter 2 if it sounds useful?

Implementation:
* SIFT implementation low priority
* Flowchart for pipelines potentially


Project:
- Update README to be a proper README
- read it over again while keeping the assessment guidelines in mind
