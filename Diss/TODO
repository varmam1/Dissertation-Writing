Overall:
- Look over captions of figures

Intro:
- Stronger hook sentence and motivations

ROB:

1.2 

* better recognize missing children and match them with their parents 
    - in the case where we have no photo? or the child has aged beyond recognition? 

* - I guess reunite families when photographs are not available for comparison?

(is there a little more to say here given comments such as "been aware of the social and ethical impact of your work." in the marking criteria) 

* 1.3 related work

* Could you group the approaches taken in some way and represent this visually even? a taxonomy? "One paper…" sounds like the related work might be incomplete. 

e.g. "Approaches to kinship recognition can be broadly grouped…."??

* How do the techniques compare beyond accuracy? 
  One thing that springs to mind is predictions of confidence, might this be important in this sort of application? 
  Have people explored getting such metrics? 

1.4 

Is it more than simply reproducing results, you wanted to understand something, verify their results perhaps using additional techniques that they did not report?

Perhaps make the nature of the biases more explicit? 

Why is it sensible to include images from the same photograph in the dataset? It seems like you would be asking for trouble? Is there no way to pre-process the data set to remove backgrounds or normalise lighting on the face? Is this not done typically? Could you highlight this sort of thing as an issue? (sorry, I may have asked this before perhaps)

Prep:
- Redraw/source figures
- Maybe move SIFT to appendix

ROB:
* A thought: do you fulfill the requirements listed here: 
https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist-v2.0.pdf
(Machine Learning Reproducibility Checklist from the NeurIPS 2020 conference)
If so, perhaps you could claim it, or add it as a requirement in Chapter 2 if it sounds useful?

* The first paragraph of Chapter 2 doesn't add a huge amount IMHO. 
"In this chapter…."

* Chapter 2 is quite long perhaps.  

* 2.7 - do you analyse the problem and formulate a strategy for how you are going to tackle it? 
        perhaps determine the difficulty/risk associated with each part of the project too? a strategy for managing risk perhaps? 

Implementation:
* SIFT implementation low priority
* Flowchart for pipelines potentially
- Do you know if the same person/people appear(s) in multiple (pairs of) images? If so, then it's possible that different images of the same person could end up in different folds, and then the model could be tested on someone that it remembers from the training set.

Evaluation:
- More in-depth analysis in certain places

ROB:
Not sure about the first introductory paragraph. Is there a way to make more interesting at the moment it is a short table of contents.

4.1. 

Is the work in [4] worth discussing/highlighting better somewhere? (do you only cite on p.41?)

Project:
- Update README to be a proper README

- Add appendices for cascade classifiers. 

- read it over again while keeping the assessment guidelines in mind
