        - Give tree structure of the repository
        - Explain how it was modularized 
        - Explain that it was written from scratch and most 
            modules just use base functionality of numpy
            (with exceptions of VGG and face detection)

    - General Overview of Pipeline
        - Put datasets into proper format
        - Get Face Descriptors for each image and save
        - Run WGEML on each fold of the dataset
        - Get predictions for each test fold of dataset
        - Output accuracies

            - KFW had them pre-done but TSKinFace didn't 
            - Talk about how made TSKinFace neg pairs (ie. Randomly)
        - PCA
            - Need to use PCA to reduce dimensions for sake of efficiency

        - Talk about differences in accuracy when use a different test for KFW-II and TSKinFace but not present in KFW-I as significantly
    - Ablation Studies
        - Face Descriptors
            - Talk about how choosing different face descriptors changed things
            - VGG is important in conjunction with others analysis 
            - More FDs => Better accuracy
            - Diminishing returns on accuracy as add FDs
        - Blocking parts of the image (If End up doing this extension)
            - (Specifics to be added when done)

        - (Specifics to be added when done)
